# Get Started
Here is a quick start to make a nice github page.

```
#tool up
npm install -g doc-n-toc
#go to your git repository, set up for github pages
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
#... write a manual in a markdown file ... :)
doc-n-toc manual.md --title MyProject > index.html
git add manual.md index.html
git commit -m 'yep, simple gh pages'
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
```

And done. Fire up your browser at `http://[username].github.io/[repo]`

# How It Works
This will take a markdown and compile it to a single page
doc site, inline everything -- which gives you a stand along html
document you can publish or share. So, not only can you publish it on
the web, you can email it whole or read it offline. Fonts, styles,
scripts, and all. One page 'app' meets website.

The table of contents is auto-generated by simply looking at your `h1`
`h2` ahd `h3` tags. So, just make headings, and the TOC is built for
you. Thanks [Greg Allen](https://github.com/jgallen23/toc).

And, you can have multiple files and break up your work, just pass
multiple files to `doc-n-toc` and it will glue them end to end for you
and make a nice big manual page.
